# BintyByte Technologies Website - Project Summary

This document provides a concise overview of the current state of the BintyByte Technologies website project for future reference and development continuity.

## 1. Project Overview
- **Company Name**: BintyByte Technologies Private Limited
- **Objective**: A modern, production-ready, client-side rendered website for a data & cloud engineering firm.
- **Aesthetic**: Futuristic, "Agentic AI". Clean, modern, and professional.

## 2. Branding & Design
- **Primary Colors**: A vibrant gradient of Fuchsia, Purple, and Blue.
- **Theme**: Supports Light, Dark, and System modes with persistence in `localStorage`.
- **Inspiration**:
    - **UI/UX**: Inspired by the structure and clarity of major cloud provider websites (e.g., AWS).
    - **Color Palette**: Inspired by `cssgradient.io`.

## 3. Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (loaded via CDN).
- **Routing**: `react-router-dom` (using `HashRouter`).
- **Animations**: `framer-motion`.
- **Architecture**:
    - **Modular Structure**: All source code resides within the `src` directory, organized by feature (`components`, `pages`, `hooks`, `contexts`, etc.). The main entry point is `index.tsx`, which renders `src/App.tsx`. The redundant `App.tsx` file in the root directory has been removed.
    - **Theme Management**: Centralized theme logic is handled via React Context (`src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`).

## 4. Key Features Implemented
### 4.1. Responsive Navigation
- A fully responsive header with a sticky top position.
- A slide-out panel for the main navigation on mobile devices.

### 4.2. AWS-Style Mega-Menu
- **Activation**: Click-activated on the "Products" link.
- **Desktop View**:
    - A full-width, two-panel dropdown menu that appears below the header.
    - Left panel shows a scrollable list of product categories.
    - Right panel displays the products for the currently selected category.
    - Includes a dedicated close button and closes on outside click.
- **Mobile View**:
    - A full-screen, multi-level navigation experience.
    - Users can drill down into categories and then back up.
    - Smooth, animated transitions between levels.
    - This is a unified component (`MegaMenu.tsx`) that handles both desktop and mobile states.

### 4.3. Content & Pages
- **Structure**: Multi-page architecture implemented with React Router.
- **Pages Created**: Homepage, Why Us, Products, Solutions, Pricing, Resources, About, and Contact.
- **Content**: All placeholder content has been updated to reflect the "BintyByte" brand.

## 5. Current Status
- **Branding**: Fully implemented.
- **Styling**: Core theme and color palette applied globally.
- **Mega-Menu**: The primary complex feature is implemented and functional on all screen sizes, resolving previous layout bugs.
- **Architecture**: The project is organized into a clean, scalable folder structure.
- **Next Steps**: Focus on content refinement, form integrations (e.g., captcha), and CI/CD setup.
